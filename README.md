# Prediction-Projects

The project is “Targeted Advertising”. At its most basic, targeted advertising can just mean that ads are chosen for their relevance to site content, in the assumption that
they will then be relevant to the site audience as well. Online advertisers can use different methods to target a particular advertisement on the user based on its traits.
Most of company do this as part of social media like Facebook, LinkedIn etc. But most of the times the process goes wrong and the advertisement does not reach its target audience
because it is sent out without actually understanding the probability of the occurring click.

In this project, we are going to work on an advertising dataset, indicating whether or not a particular internet user has clicked on an Advertisement.

The goal is to predict if a user would click on an advertisement based on the features of the user.
